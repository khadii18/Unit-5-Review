# Part 1: HTML

1. Create an input box. Give it a placeholder and a class.
2. Create a button. Give it a class.

# Part 2: Javascript

3. Create variables for the input box, the button, and the result div.
4. Create a click handler.
5. Use .value to read the contents of the input box and store it in a variable called userInput.
6. Create a conditional to show the user an image based on what they picked.

NOTE: there are many ways to do this step!!!! You can use .innerHTML or .style.display = 'block' - it all depends on what you prefer.
